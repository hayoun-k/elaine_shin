	<p>
		After graduating UCLA during the pandemic, I started working full-time at the same company where I was interning and then part-time freelancing at.	</p>

	<p>
		I have been climbing up the ladder in my career at a rapid pace. It's been exhilarating and affirming, but it has been a journey that comes with a lot of uncertainty.
	</p>

	<p>
		And whenever I encounter a dilemma, I always reflect. I find solid ground by reflecting on both myself and how I work. So, I'm finally putting down my mental models.
	</p>

	<p>
		There will be a mixture of marinated thoughts but also rough takes as I navigate how I think. Learn, critique, and resonate with me.
